CT_Timer v1.1 (1600)r
-----------------------------
CT_Timer works as both a countdown timer and a stopwatch timer. To use it counting up, simply click the numbers to start and stop. To reset it, click the reset button below the timer. To use it as a countdown timer, use the arrows on the right to set minutes and the left to set hours, then click the numbers to start or stop. 

If you start the timer counting up or down, then hide it, the timer will continue. A chat message will be sent once the timer reaches 0 counting down.

The timer can also be used via these slash commands:

/timer - shows the help info
/timer [show/hide] - shows or hides the timer
/timer secs [on/off] - toggles whether seconds are shown or not

CTMod users will also find these options in the control panel.

New in 1.1 - You can now start/pause the timer with the command(or macro):

/script CT_Timer_Toggle(CT_TimerFrame)

CT_UnitFrames v1.65 (1700)r
-----------------------------
The improved PlayerFrame has 4 settings. They allow you to show a smaller font style on hp/mana which makes the bar more visible behind the text, and/or show a percentage to the right of each bar. You can set it to show only hp/mana values, only percentages, all, or none via the control panel option for PlayerFrame.\r\n\r\nThe TargetFrame has also been improved by showing a percentage of your targets hp and their exact mana value provided they have mana. If a group member or your own pet is targeted, it will show their exact hp value instead of a percentage. Percentages, mana, or both can be turned off via the control panel option for TargetFrame.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**:  If upgrading to version 1.6+ of CTMod from an older version, you will need to delete CT_PlayerFrame and CT_TargetFrame from your AddOns directory.  Those AddOns were combined into CT_UnitFrames for 1.6+.

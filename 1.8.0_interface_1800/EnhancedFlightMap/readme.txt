Description
-----------
Add a full flight map display at the flight master screen!  Instead of having to remember that to get from Crossroads to Shadowprey Village you can fly to any of three points (at the moment) and then on to Shadowprey Village, actually see it on the flight master screen!

Also, this addon will time your flights and display the time in flight with a count down window so you can see how long you have when starting a flight (perfect for that, I want to grab a quick drink/bite to eat/pizza/whatever).

Lastly the addon also displays the locations of flight masters on your zone map window to allow you to find that "missing" flight master when you are wandering around...


Notes
-----
For a while I have been using an addon VisibleFlightMap, and there was many deficiancies with the addon.  Mostly related to lack of data, and lack of automation of new flight paths.

Therefore this is an almost complete recode of the original addon, with a few new features.

Anyhow, hopefully this addon is well received.

Oh, and before people ask, this addon appears to work find for BOTH horde and alliance flight paths.  


Usage
-----
Initially the addon is in a learning mode, meaning it has no knowledge of any flightpaths in the world, and you need to train it by visiting flight masters and looking at the screen.  As you learn new flight paths it will update it's data set automatically (this also means if blizzard adds new flightpaths you will show them automatically when you see them).

The program does have a few slash commands however, to view them, please use /efm or /efm help.

Other than that, the addon operates all the time, so enjoy.

Special Thanks
--------------
Special thanks go to the authors of the following addons as without their addon, this addon would not be possible in it's current form.
VisibleFlightMap   - The original program I based my addon off, this is so modified and re-written that it is almost unrecognizable as having come from there, so I'm listing it here so the original author gets credit for their idea.
Kwarz's FlightPath - Kwarz appears to have stopped developing this one, so I've snaffled sections of his code for use in my addon, I had to re-write it to suit my data structures, and some sections I have just used his concepts, but the code concept for things like the flight timers are all taken from this addon.

Also, without the following people the addon would be missing a lot of it's features:-
Bam at Curse-gaming     	 - For supplying the Alliance flight data for the continent of Azeroth.
jgleigh at Curse-gaming 	 - For supplying additional alliance flight data.
Corwin Whitehorn at curse-gaming - For supplying the french translations, thanks Corwin!
Gazzis at curse-gaming		     - For supplying the german translations, thanks Gazzis!
Khisanth at curse-gaming and worldofwar.net - For supplying the unicode update for the translations, and for giving me the site to hunt for further changes.

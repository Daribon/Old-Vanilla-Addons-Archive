CT_PartyBuffs v1.45 (1500)r
-----------------------------
In the control panel, you will now find two options regarding party buffs. The first toggles them on or off, which will show small buff icons under your party members health/mana bars. That toggle also has a 3rd option that will allow pet classes to turn the mod on only for their pets. The second option lets you specify how many buffs you would like to show. It can be set at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 buffs per player. Debuffs will display below the buffs in a second row.

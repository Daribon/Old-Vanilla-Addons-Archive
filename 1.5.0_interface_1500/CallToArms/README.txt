About Call To Arms:
-------------------

Call To Arms (CTA) was created to help players who are having trouble getting 
into raids for any instances or otherwise. CTA works like a search engine, 
allowing players to host, find and join raids very quickly and easily like 
never before.

CTA lets raid leaders create a profile of their raid. This profile includes a 
short description, the maximum size wanted, the minimum level of the players in 
the raid and even a password to join. Raid leaders can even set the class 
distribution of the raid members.

Players can also use CTA to search for these raids using various search criteria. 
When a suitable raid is found, players can easily ask for an invitation to the 
raid. Even if the players do not have CTA, they can still request an invitation by 
sending a whisper to the raid leader.

CTA will automatically invite players who meet the requirements of the raid, ie. 
an invitation will be sent only if the player has the correct class and level needed 
by the raid group.

CTA operates on a single channel (CTA channel) and has several anti-spam features. 
Communication is efficient and lightweight - only queries are sent over the CTA 
channel - at a maximum rate of once per 5 seconds per user. When not in use, CTA 
automatically removes the player from the CTA channel, so broadcast overhead to the 
server is minimal.

Installation:
-------------

Copy Interface folder and its contents to your World of Warcraft installation folder 
(eg. C:/Program Files/World of Warcraft/)

----

Most of CTA's features are accessed by clicking on a red button on your screen. 
This button will appear when you start World of Warcraft after you have installed CTA.

Note: If you are hosting a raid, players who do not have CTA can still join your 
raids automatically by sending a whisper to you with the message 'inviteme' or 
'inviteme raidpassword', if you raid is password protected, replacing 'raidpassword' 
with your password.

Commands: type '/cta' for a list of available commands and '/cta help' for details on

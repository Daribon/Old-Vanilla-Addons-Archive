Simple interface addition, which recolors the action bar buttons when your selected target is out of range, or when you are out of mana/rage etc.

No more guessing if your spell or ranged attack will hit that mob now, the action bar buttons will visually change color and be shaded differently showing you are out of range and will brighten back to full color to indicate when you are within range again and that button is usable.

Some action bar mods are starting to add this 'out of range' functionality to their addons, but at present theres only a few mods that do recolor themselves, such as CTMod and Discord. However, alot of people use other bars in combination with these too such as FlexBar which is popular, then you could often get a mismatch of shaded icons in various colors.

RangeRecolor adds the range recoloring to all action bars that don't currently have that functionality, which is actually the majority of action bars. Then it checks for action bars that have their own recoloring like CTMod and replaces their function with it's own recoloring instead.

RangeRecolor works with popular action bar addons plus the original Blizzard standard bars too, therefore adding the functionality to all bars and in the process recoloring them all the same.

Furthermore, you can use a simple slash command or the check box on the options panel to switch between red or grey shaded icons, but if you don't like the colors you only have to open up the rangerecolor.lua and change the color setting at the top, then all the supported action bars will be recolored to whatever shade you like.

Slash commands:

/rr options panel to enable/disable, choose recolor and set defaults.
/rr red to enable red shaded icons (default)
/rr grey to enable grey shaded icons

Or use the options panel to select shading color.

CT_BuffMod v1.73 (1300)r
-----------------------------
Buff names and durations are now visible, debuffs show with a red outline. By default, when a buff is about to fade, a chat message will be sent alerting you of this. Both Buff durations and Chat Warnings can be hidden via the control panel. 

By unlocking the buff frame via the control panel, you can now move the buffs to your selected location. Also, while unlocked, you can right click the move button to rotate the buff icons, which will place the icon on the right with the text to the left, for those who don''t want names running off screen.

The ability to change the text color on debuffs has also been added. To make debuffs more noticeable, you can toggle the text color to red via the control panel.

As of 1.7+ you can now select the Default buff layout which will move the buffs from the right side back to the top, as well as add mini timers under each icon.

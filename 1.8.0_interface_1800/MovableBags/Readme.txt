MovableBags v1.1 (4216)

MovableBags is a standalone mod that was not made by the CTMod team.  This mod has been modified to work with commands in the CT Control Panel.

In short, it allows you to click&drag your bags.

If you have problems with bags showing up behind your bank window after installing this mod, you will need to change your UI scale via interface options or your resolution to be able to move the bags out from behind the window.  After moving them to a new location, you can set your UI scale or resolution back to normal and the bags will remain where you left them.

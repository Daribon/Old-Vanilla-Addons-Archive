1. What is it?
--------------

It is an interface between buff addons (such as BuffBot) and ActionQueue. 
This allows for "background" buffing, without the user needing to concern 
themselves much about it.



2. What is it not?
------------------

It is not a bot, exploit or hack. It simply allows the buff addon to use 
"leftover" keypresses to trigger the casting of buffs.



3. Known limitations
--------------------

It does not work well when one of your party members duel another party member. 

Also, it does not concern itself with PvP - if it wants to trigger, it WILL 
auto-buff a player that is in PvP when you are not. This may be fixed.

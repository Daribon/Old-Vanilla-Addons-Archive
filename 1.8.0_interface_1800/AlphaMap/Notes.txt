Edited :

This is v1.7 of AlphaMap of Jeromy Walsh. He did not update the addon from version 1.3.1; so I have added BG support to it and released v1.7

I didn't try this version in Warsong BG and Alterac BG. Because I can't enter them for a while. The addon work well with Arathi Basin BG

If you get any error messages in some map zones, please inform me to correct. My email xtro_free@hotmail.com

-----------------

This is v1.3.1 of the AlphaMap add-on for World of Warcraft.  
If you have additional suggestion, please feel free to send them on to DragonWalsh@yahoo.com

Known Issues:  Currently the only known issues are that there is an "extra" icon on the map, which is a result of the minimap inheritance.  This "extra" icon is the icon designating which direction your team members are from you, and appears whenever they are more than the minimap's radius away from you.

Additionally, there seems to be some conflicts with layering and Cosmos.  If something is under the AlphaMap and shouldn't be, its likely that Cosmos or something else has moved the frame behind the AlphaMap.  Just click that frame to bring it to
the front.

Enjoy!

Wishlist for EnhancedFlightMap
==============================

This is the wishlist file for EnhancedFlightMap.

Before I start on a new release I look at this file and see what can be done right now, what needs to be done soon, and basically decide what I want to work on next.

Each time I complete a task in the "for next release" section, I generally will do a release at that time, of course it depends on what it is, sometimes I will do two (or more), other times just one.

Also, until I complete all "Future Goals" I do not add anymore wishlist items.  I do however have a rule that anything I think might be interesting, I'll just add automatically, and anything I think will be usefull also gets added.

As this is a hobby, I want to keep this as short a list as possible, as I'm not complete with the addon until this list has no more items in it.


For next release (if possible)
------------------------------

- Korean localization

- Flight path display when not at flight master.


Future goals
------------

- Add option to be able to move the in-flight timer.

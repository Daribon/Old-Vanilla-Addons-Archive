For AddOn developers:

PartyComm
an AddOn designed to facilitate behind the scenes party communication.

History:

added delay to initial channel join so partycomm channels are less likely to take a low channel ID
v1.0 (1/21/05)
initial release

Description

PartyComm is general purpose AddOn created to allow other AddOn's to communicate between party members invisibly.  Full documentation is included in the PartyComm.lua file.  PartyComm was created to help keep channel clutter at a minimum as more client/server style AddOn's are created.  UltimateUI contains a nearly identical functionality via the ZParty channel, but of course, is limitted to UltimateUI users.  Because UltimateUI has modified the base files in FrameXML, extracting ZParty for general use does not seem possible.  I encourage any AddOn developers creating a client/server based AddOn for party members to look into using PartyComm.  Feel free to redistribute PartyComm with your AddOn.

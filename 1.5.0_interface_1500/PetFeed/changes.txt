changes in version 1.1 (05/01/2005)
-----------------------------------

- There was a misspelling in the german localization with fruit and fungus, which is 
  now "Obst" and "Fungus".
- changed the arguments for adding and removing food to "+" and "-" (less typing).
- changed german localization for content and happy to "Zufrieden" and "Glücklich".
- At last I found out why some pets didn't eat at all. This was because PF only reacted 
  on a change of the happiness level, which is sent by the client as an event. 
  When the pet was as unhappy as possible at the time the food was added, the pet would
  never eat because the happiness never changed. So now I let it check if it is in the mood
  for eating everytime food is added. That should solve the problem.
- changed english food names to start with Uppercase (thanks to GandalfTW)
- fixed the remove food function, it should work properly now. 
  You should always use Shift+ClickonItem to add the item name when adding and removing food.

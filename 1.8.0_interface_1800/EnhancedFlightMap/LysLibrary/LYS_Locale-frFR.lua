French Localizations.

Most of these where provided by Corwin Whitehorn at curse-gaming for my EFM addon.

Due to the way localizations work with WoW, the locale strings override the default strings, hence the reason we do not need to list all available strings in this file, only those that need localization.

if ( GetLocale() == "frFR" ) then

LYS_MONEYTEXT_GOLD		= "o";
LYS_MONEYTEXT_SILVER	= "a";
LYS_MSG_LOADED			= " charg\195\169e.";

end

A castingbar replacement mod: by elvendawn (c0elvenn@yahoo.com)
	-Changed graphics, complete overhaul from blizzards.
	-Added CastingTime mod into the.
	-Added moveablity via unlock and lock commands, 
		uses an outline frame to help move as the bar 
		when unlocked sense its always hidden unless casting.
	-Added PerlStatusBar texture to the bar, disablable via toggletexture (toggle).
	-Can Enable/Disable the mod (defaults enabled) 
	-Fixed blizzards code.
		-the bar now correctly shows channeling color,
		 as in blizzards bar, Spellupdate event forced it 
		 to yellow (default casting color).
		-the bar Spark now correctly shows up for channeling
		 as it didn't work on blizzards (the spark is that small 
		 yellow glowing end cap on the progressbar).

		 
Things I wanted to do, but never goto:
	-Convert to Ace.
	-Make an options menu
	-Add the option to change bar colors, size, border type color and alpha, 
	 background color and alpha, the CastingTime Format.
	-Add icon support: a little icon to the left, or movable like all 
	 discord unit frames stuff =P that displayed the spell. 
	-Make it Reusable (via classes w/ Ace) and cope it to Breathing/fatigue bars.
	 which would also make avaliable for any other developer to call for a visual timer.

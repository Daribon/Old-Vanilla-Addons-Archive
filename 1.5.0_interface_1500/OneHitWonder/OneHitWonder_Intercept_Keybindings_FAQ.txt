One Hit Wonder Intercept Keybindings FAQ 
Version 0.1 - by Sarf

What is Intercept Keybindings?
------------------------------

Basically, it is a piece of code that is "piggybacked" when you do stuff like 
move left, right, look around with the mouse and so on.

Why?
----

Because it is the only way to "automate" casting of spells. Actually, what it 
does is that it only "piggybacks" casting of spells on buttons that can not 
cast spells normally, which is what makes OHW look like it's "autobuffing."

What does it do, specifically?
------------------------------

Well, it kinda depends. :)

You see, each class have its own functionality, and all code in OHW can "queue 
up" spells that will be cast as soon as possible. Such spells are cast at the 
earliest time possible, which either is on an intercepted keybinding or when 
you press the OHW button.

I have tried to break it down by class here, but this is by necessity an 
incomplete list as OHW is continually changing and growing:

Druid
 Autobuff Mark of the Wild, Thorns
 Autocure Poison
 Autobuff Omen of Clarity

Hunter
 Autobuff Aspect

Mage
 Autobuff Frost/Ice/Mage Armor, Mana Shield
 Autocure Curses
 (if enemy starts casting Fire/Frost spell, use the appropriate Ward)
 (optional auto-Counterspell if enemy starts to cast something, should be made more selective)

Paladin

Priest
 Autobuff PW:F, Inner Fire, Shadow Protection, Divine Spirit (talent spell)
  racial buff:
   Shadowguard (Trolls, self only), Elune's Grace (Night Elves), Fear Ward (Dwarves)

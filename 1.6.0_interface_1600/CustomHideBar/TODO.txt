Some ideas which may or may not be implemented in future versions.

- Add keybindings to all toolbars
- Make the toolbars scalable
- Let the user change orientation (vertical or horizontal) of all bars
- Make the spell casting progress bar movable
- Add commands for specifying z-order of all toolbars so they'd not get
  overlaped by open bags etc

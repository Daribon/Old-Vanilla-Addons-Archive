About Atlas
-----------

Atlas is a user interface mod for World of Warcraft that provides a simple in-game instance map browser. Typing the command '/atlas' or clicking the mini-map icon will open the Atlas window. Through the options panel you can disable the icon, toggle Auto Select, change the icon's position, or adjust the transparency of the main window. If the Auto Select option is enabled Atlas will automatically open to the map of the instance you're in. Move Atlas around simply by left-clicking and dragging. Use the small padlock icon in the upper-right corner to lock the window in place. Atlas includes a map for every instance in the game. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback please feel free to contact me.

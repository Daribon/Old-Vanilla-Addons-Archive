        * Nuked Sky dependency

        * Added raid buff viewing (per-tab)

2005-04-02  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* RaidMinion.lua: Fixed logic bug that was
	causing us to try to send debuff updates for
	your mouseover target, among other things.

2005-03-26  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* RaidMinion.lua: added optional sending of
	your target data; has to be explicitly enabled

	* RaidMinion.lua: use pcall() for callback functions
	instead of invoking directly

2005-03-26  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* RaidMinionUI.lua: don't use | in chat print string

2005-03-18  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* RaidMinion.lua: Don't call DidGroupChange in
	ResetGroup, since it will always return false there
	(since we just called it recently).

	* Fix tabs not showing up on joining a raid.

	* Don't complain if UnitName() returns nil for
	someone in our group

	* Fix /rm auto class, wasn't updating on click

2005-03-17  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Added /rm auto, auto-population of tabs
	with either everyone in the current raid, or
	auto setup of class lock, one per tab.  Also
	available through two Cosmos buttons.
	
	* Added better tracking of tab hiding and showing.
	
2005-03-17  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Bumped RM data version number to 2, due to below
	massive bug fix.

	* Fixed bug causing updates to not get sent (Sky was
	bandwidth limiting alerts, which would lock us out
	from sending for ~20s at a time).  This bugfix is in
	Sky; make sure you update Sky.
	
	* Fixed watching for expired data; if someone stops sending,
	stale data will no longer be kept around.

	* Drop debuffs that we can't send due to size, instead of
	just not sending any debuffs

	* Updated number of tabs to 8 (so 8 tabs, 10 players each)

2005-03-16  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* More tweaking to intervals

	* Added /rm disablesend and /rm enablesend, in case someone is
	lagging (but they're the alphabetic sender)

2005-03-01  AnduinLothar  <karlkfi@cosmosui.org>
	* Added Meteorologist SkyCloud Menu registration

2005-03-07  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Fixed bug in debuff updating for non-RMUI users

2005-03-05  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Added /rm reset

	* Fixed the clearing of expired players (callback wasn't
	being scheduled for whatever reason)

2005-03-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Fixed targetting 10th player in a tab

	* Fixed selecting multiple classes per tab, erm.

2005-03-03  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Added ability to select more than one class for a tab

2005-03-02  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Fixed debuff names with ":"'s in them from screwing up
	the reception (:'s just get stripped now)

	* Fixed the damn tooltip for debuffs

	* Fixed debuff sending to split into max datagram size chunks.
	Still needs heavy testing to make sure we don't spam.

2005-03-01  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Added debuff sending; also added debuff label type, and option
	to show/hide debuff icons.  Tooltip coming soon to be able to
	hover over the icons.

	* Added ability to select a class to show in a tab; right-click a tab
	and select a class (probably would need to /rm show # first).

	* Added /rm scale to change size/scaling (directly
	calls SetScale, so be aware of what this does with UIScale, e.g.
	can move things off the screen; option is hidden in help because
	of this)

	* Fixed updates not being sent initially

	* Fixed "?" remaining next to names even after update is received

	* Fixed RM not appearing when you log in and/or reloadui while in a raid

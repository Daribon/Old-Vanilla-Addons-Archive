	* Fixed bug in debuff updating for non-RMUI users

2005-03-05  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Added /rm reset

	* Fixed the clearing of expired players (callback wasn't
	being scheduled for whatever reason)

2005-03-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Fixed targetting 10th player in a tab

	* Fixed selecting multiple classes per tab, erm.

2005-03-03  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* Added ability to select more than one class for a tab

	* Fixed debuff names with ":"'s in them from screwing up
	the reception (:'s just get stripped now)

	* Fixed the damn tooltip for debuffs

	* Fixed debuff sending to split into max datagram size chunks.
	Still needs heavy testing to make sure we don't spam.

	* Added debuff sending; also added debuff label type, and option
	to show/hide debuff icons.  Tooltip coming soon to be able to
	hover over the icons.

	* Added ability to select a class to show in a tab; right-click a tab
	and select a class (probably would need to /rm show # first).

	* Added /rm scale to change size/scaling (directly
	calls SetScale, so be aware of what this does with UIScale, e.g.
	can move things off the screen; option is hidden in help because
	of this)

	* Fixed updates not being sent initially

	* Fixed "?" remaining next to names even after update is received

	* Fixed RM not appearing when you log in and/or reloadui while in a raid

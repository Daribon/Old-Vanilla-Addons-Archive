SeeAllDebuffs v1.0

This is a simple mod that lets you see all 8 debuffs on a mob (very important for debuff classes or any raid that needs to control their debuffs for raid mobs). Really this is such an obvious oversight on Blizzard's part that I'm surprised that someone has not come out with a mod to do this before now (at least I wasn't been able to find any). 

The last 3 debuffs are lowered slightly on the screen to avoid drawing over the target portrait. You can mouse over them and see the applicable tooltip just like the regular debuff icons.

Usage:

Just unzip in your AddOns directory and go. You can disable it with /SeeAllDebuffs disable or /sad disable, reenable with /SeeAllDebuffs enable or /sad enable. SeeAllDebuffs is automatically enabled at startup (disabled setting not saved).

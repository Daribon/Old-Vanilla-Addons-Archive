--About--
 This mod assists the fisherman by making it easy to cast,
 and easy to switch to the fishing poles and back.
  When a fishing pole is equipped, right clicking will cause
 the player to cast their line.

--Installation Info--
 Simply extract TackleBox.zip to your Interface/Addons folder

--Dependencies--
 Required: Sea
 Optional: MCom, Sky, Khaos, Cosmos, myAddOns

 This mod comes with an embeded version of MCom, so you don't need to load MCom as a seperate addon to use it. But if you do, then the seperate addon MCom will take precidence over the embeded one.

 a few tweaks and fixes.  Oh and the Shift click option.  Aalny did a
 fair amount of good work.

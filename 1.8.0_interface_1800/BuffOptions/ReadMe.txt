--About--
 BuffOptions is an addon that allows you to
 customize the display and behavior of your buffs.
  It allows you to stack your buffs vertically
 reverse them, swap their position with the debuffs
 show reminders when a buff is about to expire, and more.

--GUI Information--
 This addon supports both Khaos and Cosmos, which will give you graphical configuration options, for every option this addon has.  You can obtain Cosmos and Khaos from http://www.cosmosui.org

--Installation Info--
 Simply extract BuffOptions.zip to your Interface/Addons folder

--Dependencies--
 Required: Sea
 Optional: MCom, Sky, Cosmos, Khaos, myAddOns, MobileFrames

 This mod comes with an embeded version of MCom, so you don't need to load MCom as a seperate addon to use it. But if you do, then the seperate addon MCom will take precidence over the embeded one.

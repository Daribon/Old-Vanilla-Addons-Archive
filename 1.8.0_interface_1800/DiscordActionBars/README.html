<a name="1"><b>Overview:</b></a><br><br>

This mod provides you with 10 action bars that can use all 120 action buttons.  Each bar is hella configurable.  You can also place buttons that aren't attached to any bar (referred to as "floaters").  Lastly, the mod also creates control boxes that can be used to setup a neat menu for showing and hiding bars without the need for macros.

<center><a href=#top class="top">Back to Top</a></center><br>

<a name="2"><b>The Features:</b></a><br><br>

<li>You can define the number of buttons each bar holds.</li>
<li>The appearance of the buttons is fully customizable: size, transparency, space between buttons, numbers of rows to use, hide empty buttons, and more.</li>
<li>You can configure a background to display behind the buttons.</li>
<li>Bars can be set to display when you're in combat, have a hostile target, when you move the mouse over the bar, when you hold down a specific key, and more.</li>
<li>You can configure "control boxes", special buttons that can be configured to show a bar when clicked or you move the mouse over them.</li>
<li>Bars and control boxes can be attached to other bars and control boxes so that they move together.</li>
<li>You can configure "floaters", buttons that are free of any bar.</li>
<li>You can define macros that run in response to game events.  These macros do not use up any of your base 18 macros.</li>
<li>You can configure the pet action, shapeshift, bag, and micro menu bars.</li>
<li>You can save and load different settings without having to relog or reload the ui.</li>

You access the options window by typing /dab. <br>
The top set of buttons on the left-side of the screen are used to select an action bar to configure.<br>
The Other Bars button is used to configure the Pet Action, Shapeshift, Bag, and Menu bars.<br>
The Num Buttons button brings up a window where you can set the number of buttons each bar holds.<br>
The Floaters button brings up the options window for buttons that aren't attached to any bar.<br>
On Event Macros is where you define macros to be run in response to game events.<br>
Misc Options holds various options that don't fit in other categories.<br>
Clicking the Unlock Dragging button will allow you to move all frames created by DAB by dragging them to where you want them.  Clicking the button again will re-lock all the frames.  You can also hold Ctrl to override the dragging lock.  A bar's label can also be always be used to drag a bar.<br>
The Lock Buttons button will keep you from dragging actions out of all the buttons.  <br>

The Quick Save button will save your settings using your character's name as the settings name.<br>
The Quick Load button will load your settings using your character's name as the settings name.<br><br>
All edit boxes require you to hit enter before they update the value they modify.<br>
All sliders have an edit box attached to them where you can type in a value instead of using the slider.  For most of those edit boxes you can type in a value that's greater or less than what the slider allows.  This will disable the slider until you type in a value that's within the slider's range.

These macros do not use any of your base 18 macros and have a limit of 7500 characters, so go nuts.   The macro will be executed every single time the event is thrown.  See the section  <a href="#13" class="top">Useful Functions</a> for a list of handy functions this mod provides and see the section <a href="#14" class="top">Event Macro Examples</a> for examples of how to display a button when your health's low, when your opponent dodges, etc.

<a name="12.5"><b>Setting Up Bars That Switch When You Shapeshift:</b></a><br><br>
First, go to Misc Options and set the Main Bar for Shapeshift to whatever bar number you want the shapeshift bars to switch with.  Then go to the options for another bar and set the Use For Shapeshift Form option to whatever form you want to use with that bar.  Underneath there, set the When I Shapeshift option to Swap With Main Bar.  Once that's done, the next time you actually change stances, stealth, or shift into an animal form the bars will swap.  It's important to remember that the correct bar will not be in the Main Bar until you actually change forms.  For warriors, this means you need to switch to a different stance from your current one.  For druids and rogues, the main bar won't have the correct bar until you stealth or shift to an animal form from humanoid form (so if you setup your bar while stealthed or in an animal form, you won't have the correct bar in the main bar until you leave stealth/animal form and re-enter stealth/an animal form).  Another tip for warriors is to remove all the buttons from your main bar before you change stances for the first time or you'll never see those buttons again.  Bars only swap buttons and not settings so your shapeshift bars will appear however you set the main bar to appear and your keybindings for the main bar will be applied to whatever shapeshift bar it currently holds.

<a name="13"><b>Useful Functions:</b></a><br><br>
<b>barnum</b> is a number from 1 to 10 specifying one of your action bars.<br>

<a name="14"><b>Event Macro Examples:</b></a><br><br>
<b>Showing a floater when your health drops below a certain percentage:</b><br>
Choose the Unit's Health Changed event and enter the following for the macro text.  We'll say the percent you want is 50% so it'll be shown as .50 below and the floater's number is 23.
<blockquote>
	if arg1=="player" then if UnitHealth("player")/UnitHealthMax("player") < .50 then DAB_Floater_Show(23) else DAB_Floater_Hide(23) end end
</blockquote>
This will show floater number 23 when you health is below 50% and hide it if your health is 50% or greater.  So it'll hide the button if you get a heal that takes you above 50% before you press the button.<br><br>
<b>Showing a floater when your target dodges:</b><br>
Choose the 'You Miss' Chat Message event and enter the following for macro text.  We'll say the floater is number 23.
<blockquote>
if string.find(arg1, "dodges") then DAB_Floater_Show(23); DAB_Floater_TimeToHide(23, 5); end
</blockquote>
This will cause floater number 23 to show up whenever your target dodges your attack and it will automatically hide 5 seconds later. <br><br>
<b>Swapping bars when your target enters melee range:</b><br>
Choose OnUpdate from the event macros dropdown then the enter the code below for your macro.
<blockquote>
if CheckInteractDistance("target", 1) then if (not meleebar) then setglobal("meleebar", 1); DAB_Bar_Swap(bar1, bar2); end elseif meleebar then DAB_Bar_Swap(bar1, bar2); meleebar = nil; end
</blockquote>
Replace bar1 and bar2 with the numbers of the 2 bars you want to swap.  This script will swap the 2 bars when the target moves within 5 yards of you then swap them again when the target moves further away than that. <br>
If you want to automatically swap back to your ranged bar when you lose your target, select You Change Targets from the events dropdown menu and enter the following for the macro.
<blockquote>
if (not UnitName("target")) and meleebar then DAB_Bar_Swap(bar1, bar2); meleebar = nil; end
</blockquote><br>

Do not cross-attach frames.  If bar 1 is attached to bar 3, do not also attach bar 3 to bar 1.  WoW doesn't like that and will crash.<br>
Using /say, /party, /raid, and /whisper in an On Event Macro will cause you to get disconnected.<br>
If your Pet bar or Shapeshift bar are disappearing when you click a button, disable CT_BarMod.

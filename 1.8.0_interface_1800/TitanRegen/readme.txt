5/8/05 - Happy Mothers Day!
===========================
Copy this folder into your World of Warcraft\interface\AddOns directory.  It should be parallel to Titan.  You can then right click in Titan and enable Regen as a plugin, and you should see now two new displays, HP: 0 and MP: 0.  Right click on them to toggle various display options (show percentage, show colors, show only HP or MP, etc).  Hover over the display to see more statistics in the tooltips.

I have also included a slightly tweaked TitanXP.lua, I don't like the one that comes with Titan since it displays stuff I don't care about - I just want to know how much XP i have, how much to next level, and how much restXP I have in the tooltips.  Thats all I changed.

To install this slight tweak, copy it into your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\Titan folder.  You will want to rename the existing TitanXP.lua already there to something else first.
